== Basic concept

Start with a platform (like msys2, cygwin, or a POSIX environment), and have a
fully automated build from start to finish of various software.

Currently just bash scripts.  footnote:[And only bash scripts.  More shell
scripts may come later, but my plan is to target msys2 to start with.]

== Naming

Longer is better sometimes.footnote:[Certainly not always true]footnote:[idk,
I'm not an astronaut]footnote:[footnote]  Also, to a lot of people, it's
probably worthless.

Otherwise just call is f27s.

== Licensing

No license yet, which means all rights reserved.  Thanks, capitalism!

If you have a contribution you want to add, I'll license it under an approved
OSI license.  I just can't be bothered right now, but you do have my permission
to take any actions to merely to install things.
