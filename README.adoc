== Basic concept

Start with a platform (like msys2, cygwin, or a POSIX environment), and have a
fully automated build from start to finish of various software.

Currently just bash scripts.  footnote:[And only bash scripts.  More shell
scripts may come later, but my plan is to target msys2 to start with.]

== Naming

Longer is better sometimes.footnote:[Certainly not always true]footnote:[idk,

probably worthless.

Otherwise just call is f27s.

== Conventions

All f27ses footnote:pkg[install automation] have a script.sh that you run in
that current directory.  All f27ses footnote:pkg[] will output to an
install.log.adoc, which should be able to be built using `asciidoctor -d book
install.log.adoc` footnote:[which will have an  for fancy reading.
